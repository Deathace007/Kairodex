**Last updated:** 2026-08-04
**Current phase:** P0 (Foundations) — complete, verified against live infra.
**Next phase:** P1 (The Recorder) — not started.

## 1. Decisions that changed the plan

Don't re-litigate these — each overrides SPEC.md or an earlier assumption. Full reasoning is in the linked ADR/section.

| Decision | Why it changed | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| NSE paper capital stays **₹50,000** (spec default) | User's explicit call, kept despite it being too small to properly size NSE Stock Options | ADR 0005 |
| Backtesting runs on **underlying OHLCV only** — no historical option-chain backtesting, no Upstox Plus needed | Option economics validated later in live "shadow mode" instead | ADR 0002 |
| **Backtrader dropped** — one custom engine drives both live and replayed trading | Same code path for live/replay is the only way to guarantee they agree | ADR 0001, 0003 |
| **Celery, MinIO, TA-Lib, PyFolio dropped** | Replaced by APScheduler, local file exports, Polars, in-house metrics | ADR 0004 |
| **Upstox auth = long-lived Analytics Token, not daily OAuth** | Originally designed around daily reauth (flagged as #1 operational risk); corrected once user pointed out the actual product Upstox offers | ADR 0006 |
| **Project renamed `otp` → `kairodex`** mid-P0 | Avoid the OTP/one-time-password acronym collision. Package, CLI, DB user/name, Compose project, env var prefixes all follow | — |
| **All Docker/DB/test execution moved to a remote VM**; laptop is code-editing only | Not in the original architecture — added once user clarified their actual working setup | memory `infra_vm_workflow.md` |

## 2. Where everything lives

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| **Local repo** (edit code here only) | `/Users/mohanborle/AI_ML/Kairodex` |
| **GitHub remote** | `git@personal:Deathace007/Kairodex.git` (branch `main`), via `personal` SSH host alias — `~/.ssh/config`, key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal` |
| **VM** (all Docker/DB/tests/ingestion run here) | E2E Networks, `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal root@164.52.206.92` |
| **VM repo clone** | `/opt/Kairodex` |
| **VM Compose project** | `kairodex` → containers `kairodex-timescaledb-1`, `kairodex-redis-1` |
| **VM `.env`** | `/opt/Kairodex/.env`, mode 600 — transferred via `scp -O` (see §5) |

**Workflow, always:** edit locally → commit → push → SSH to VM → `git pull` → run.

**Also on the VM, in `/opt/`:** an unrelated app `swingpro` (Compose project `infra`). Its containers/images were removed 2026-08-04 to reclaim disk (116GB was build cache); its 8 volumes were left untouched deliberately.

## 3. Quick command reference

```bash
# SSH to the VM
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal root@164.52.206.92

# On the VM: pull latest code, bring up infra
cd /opt/Kairodex && git pull origin main
source $HOME/.local/bin/env   # puts uv on PATH
docker compose up -d && docker compose ps   # both should be "healthy"

# Migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run alembic current

# Lint / type-check / test (same locally or on VM)
uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy src/kairodex/ && uv run pytest -q

# The CLI (only real command so far)
uv run kairodex ingest pull-chain --market nse --underlying "NSE_INDEX|Nifty 50" --expiry YYYY-MM-DD
uv run kairodex ingest pull-chain --market us  --underlying AAPL --expiry YYYY-MM-DD

# Inspect the DB directly
docker exec kairodex-timescaledb-1 psql -U kairodex -d kairodex -c "SELECT count(*) FROM instruments;"
```

NIFTY expiries are Tuesdays, not obvious guesses — find real ones via `client.instruments()` filtered on `underlying_symbol == "NIFTY"` before calling `pull-chain`.

**Local-only is fine for:** `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest` (no DB dependency yet). **VM only:** anything touching Postgres/Redis/live vendor calls.

---

## 4. Completed — P0 (Foundations)

All verified against live systems, not just "should work":

- Repo scaffold: `uv`, `src/kairodex` layout, ruff + mypy (strict) + import-linter — all clean.
- Docker Compose: TimescaleDB + Redis, healthy on the VM.
- Schema (migration `354672f0f639`): reference tables + market-data hypertables (compression on `option_quotes`, 30-day retention on `market_depth`). Applied on the VM.
- **Upstox adapter**: Analytics Token auth, instrument master (live-verified: 34,738 instruments, correct segment classification), option chain, historical candles, rate limiting. Live-tested: real 226-contract NIFTY chain → Timescale.
- **LSE adapter**: thin wrapper over the official `lse-data` client. Live-tested: real 126-contract AAPL chain → Timescale (after the field-name fix in §5).
- `MarketDataProvider` port shared by both adapters.
- Minimal ingest/upsert layer (`kairodex/data/ingest.py`) — the real tiered recorder is P1.
- CLI (`kairodex ingest pull-chain`) proving the path end to end.
- 6 ADRs in `docs/adr/` — see §1 for the ones that matter most.

## 5. Not done yet (explicitly out of P0 scope)

- No WebSocket/live streaming either vendor (`subscribe()` raises `NotImplementedError` — P1).
- No tiering, quality flags, feed-health monitoring, quota-aware scheduling — all P1.
- No pricing module (Greeks/IV) — P2. No engine/strategy/risk/execution — P3. No backtest — P4. No API/dashboards — P6.
- `config/segments/*.yaml` (per-segment risk config) doesn't exist yet — deferred to P3.

## 6. Implementation bugs found and fixed (not decisions — just gotchas)

1. **`.gitignore`'s `data/` pattern swallowed `src/kairodex/data/`** (the entire vendor-adapter package), being unanchored. Fixed to `/data/`. Always `git status` after adding a broad ignore pattern.
2. **LSE chain field names were guessed wrong** (`type`/`volume` vs. real `contract_type`/`volume_today`) — written without a test key. Caused a Postgres unique-constraint violation on first live test. Fixed once real credentials allowed verification.
3. **Local `.venv` broke after the repo folder was renamed** (`OptionTradingSystem` → `Kairodex`) — venv shebangs bake in absolute paths. Fixed by deleting and re-running `uv sync`. If local commands give "bad interpreter" after moving the repo, this is why.
4. **`scp` fails on the VM** — no SFTP subsystem in sshd. Use `scp -O` (legacy protocol).

## 7. Next up — P1: The Recorder

Highest priority per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §19 — every session that passes before this is live is market data that can never be recovered.

- Tiered ingestion (T0/T1/T2, §6 capacity plan)
- WebSocket streaming for both vendors (wire up `subscribe()`)
- Quality flagging (`kairodex/data/quality.py`) + feed-health tracking (`feed_health` table)
- Upstox token expiry check (annual reminder, not daily)
- Restart recovery (resume from `max(ts)` per instrument)
- Minimal status page (full dashboard is P6)

**Exit criterion:** 5 consecutive trading sessions recorded, < 0.5% gap rate on T1, clean restart mid-session with no data loss.
